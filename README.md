# Full-Crestron-Examples

This repo contains full examples of Crestron systems written in C#.  Hopefully, they'll provide ideas for how to approach A/V systems programming by going beyond SIMPL Windows.

## Blog

I may occassionally post updates to my blog at https://kielthecoder.com/ that step through these programs.  I'll try to call out the actual post URL within the README.md file inside each directory.

## Building the Examples

Each example program will likely require that Visual Studio 2019 or later be installed.  If there are specific requirements pertaining to that example, they'll be documented in the individual README.md file.

## Contributing
